Dear Sir,

<p>I am applying for the position of English Teacher in your organization with reference to the<br> advertisement on The Indian Express dated 18/04/2018. I have great interest in this position and would highly appreciate<br> it if you could consider my application.

    I have completed my Post Graduation in English and have experience of working as a High School<br> English Teacher for two years. In my teaching experience, I have come across various challenging <br>situations with kids and parents, and I have learnt to handle all of them well. I have enjoyed connecting with<br> the children and being a part of their growth and development as considerate and intelligent individuals.
    
    I have attached my resume and experience certificatez,<br> for your kind perusal and hope to hear from you in this regard.

We celebrate Indian Independence Day every year on 15 August as a national holiday in India to<br> commemorate the independence of the nation from the British on 15 August 1947. This was the day when the Indian<br> Independence Act of 1947 came into effect, which transferred the legislative sovereignty to the Indian Constituent<br> Assembly. This year, India is celebrating its 75th  Independence Day<br> 2022 as ‘AzadiKa Amrit Mahotsav 2022.’
Students can also find Independence Day Long and Short Speech in English here. Lorem, ipsum<br> dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
